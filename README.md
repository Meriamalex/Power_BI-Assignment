**Airbnb Listings & Reviews**
For this challenge I had the pleasure to analyze Airbnb data for 250,000+ listings in 10 major cities, including information about hosts, pricing, location, and room type, along with over 5 million historical reviews.


**About the dataset**
This dataset contains 2 tables, in csv format
The Listings table contains over 250,000 Airbnb listings from 10 of the worldâ€™s most visited cities (each record represents one listing), with fields containing details about the host, location, price, type, ratings, etc.
The Reviews table contains over 5,000,000 Airbnb reviews from the same 10 cities (each record represents one review), with fields containing the listing id, review date, and reviewer id
Paris and New York offer the most listings of 64.690 and 37.012 listings.
ðŸ“Œ 65% of guests preferred an entire place, followed by private rooms (31.1%), hotel rooms (2.1%) and shared rooms being last with 1.74%
ðŸ“Œ Mexico City has the best average rating with 94.84 points, followed by Rio de Janeiro. Hong Kong has the lowest rating with 89.71 points
ðŸ“Œ Sydney has the highest average dollar price with 171$ per night. The highest average price in local currency has Cape Town with 2,405 Rands
